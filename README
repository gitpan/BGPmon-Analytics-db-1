BGPmon-Analytics-db version 0.01
================================

The BGPmon Analytics Database module includes the source and scripts
necessary to set up a BGP-tracking database in Postgres and to populate it
from BGPmon output.  It is a set of scripts, not a module to be imported 
into other packages.

INSTALLATION

Install and configure Postgres according to its documentation and your
own organization's policy.  This will require at least an empty database
to install the data into, the PL/pg SQL language to be installed into
the database cluster, and at least one user with superuser access on the
database.

Once Postgres is installed and configured, have the database superuser
run bin/reset.pl, which will create the tables and data-ingestion
functions within the database.

It is recommended to initialize the database with a RIB snapshot.
This can be accomplished by either downloading an archived RIB snapshot
from an archive and running bin/database_import.pl with options to load
from a local file, or by running bin/database_import.pl with options
to use a live RIB stream from an active BGPmon.  Note that if the live
stream option is used, the user will need to keep an eye on the import
process to make sure only one RIB per peer is imported.  For this
reason, it is recommended to use the local file options.

Finally, the user can run bin/database_import.pl with options to
either connect to a live BGPmon update stream or an archive of XFB
update files.  When connecting to a live stream, the import process
will simply run as long as the BGPmon is running.  When using an
archive, only updates from the desired timerange are imported.

If the database needs to be cleared or reset, the user can run 
bin/reset.pl at any time to return the database to its original
empty configuration.  For archiving purposes, use the pgdump
utility in the Postgres distribution to dump the database to a file
before calling bin/reset.pl.

Please consult the perldoc for bin/database_import.pl or bin/reset.pl
for usage questions regarding these scripts.
