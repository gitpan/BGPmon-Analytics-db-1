BGPmon-Analytics-db version 1.01
================================

The BGPmon Analytics Database module includes the source and scripts
necessary to set up a BGP-tracking database in Postgres and to populate it
from BGPmon output.  It is a set of scripts, not a module to be imported 
into other packages.

INSTALLATION

Please Note: If other BGPmon DB tools have previously been installed it is
likely that the bgpmon_db_user and bgpmon_db have already been created. 
If that is the case, skip to step 6.

This package depends on being able to connect to a postgres installation.
The following instructions will help prepare that installation, installation
procedures may vary across platforms.
1. Install Postgresql (sudo apt-get install postgresql)
2. Create the database user bgpmon_db_user (sudo -u postgres createuser)
3. Create the database bgpmon_db 
     (sudo -u postgres createdb --owner bgpmon_db_user bgpmon_db)
4. Give a user other than root or postgres access to the database
     (should include web user):
   Edit /etc/postgresql/8.1/main/pg_hba.conf to give specific users access
   Refer to postres documentation for assitance editing the pg_hba.conf file
5. Restart postgres
6. Create the PPH schema
> cd bin
> psql -f bgpmon_analytics_db_0_pphTables.psql bgpmon_db bgpmon_db_user
> psql -f bgpmon_analytics_db_1_pphFunctions.psql bgpmon_db bgpmon_db_user
> psql -f bgpmon_analytics_db_2_pphQueryFuncs.psql bgpmon_db bgpmon_db_user
7. In order for the modules to access the scripts a password should be set
   on the bgpmon_cpm_user role. (alter role bgpmon_db_user password 'passwd';)
   This password needs to be saved in lib/BGPmon/CPM/DB.pm
   make test will fail if this is not completed
8. Build and install
> perl Makefile.PL (add PREFIX=/other/than/default if desired)
> make
> make test (optional)
> make install (use sudo if doing a root install)
